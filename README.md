My entry to create student schedules for career day.
My approach optimistically adds each student to their classes, then adds students with open periods to classes that need students, 
then move students into classes that need to fill the minimum based on a scoring function to evaluate possible class moves.

Requires valid `students.csv` and `sessions.csv` Compile and run using `cargo run`
